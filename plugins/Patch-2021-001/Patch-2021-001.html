    <strong class="profile-heading">Patch for unlocking agents</strong>
    <p>
      When upgrading to version 1.3, the agent lock changed programmatically from a boolean to an enum, 
      resulting in ThirdEye being locked - but displaying as unlocked - when you enter the application. 
      This can be resolved by simply locking and unlocking the agent manually. However, this patch 
      executes that behavior automatically.

      }
    });
