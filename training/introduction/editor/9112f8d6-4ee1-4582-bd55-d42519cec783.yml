name: Create a new payload
challenge: |
  Can you create a new payload? It should be named "hello.txt" and its contents should be "world". You can attach it
  to any TTP you like.
context: |
  You can use Operator to edit and attach payloads directly to TTPs. Select a TTP then look for the "Add a Payload"
  text at the bottom of your editor. When you click on it, you'll be able to add an existing payload (either by
  browsing to it after clicking the upload button, or by dragging it directly onto the payload editor window),
  or create a new one from scratch by giving it a new file name and entering it's contents directly.
template:
  name: submit
  data: []
resources:
  links: []
hints:
  - Look for the "Add a Payload" link at the bottom of the Editor window

  How Payloads Work: |
    Each TTP can offload part of its execution to an external attachment that will get automatically downloaded
    before the TTP runs.
answer:
  script: Listen.resolvePayloads("/uploads/hello.txt").filter(p => Encryption.decryptBuffer(fs.readFileSync(p)).toString() == "world").length
