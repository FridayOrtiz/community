name: Purple team
challenge: Which Introduction course will walk you through deploying agents and adversaries?
context: |
  Purple teams should use Operator in a fully automated way, supplying continuous security testing to their blue team.
  <ol>
    <li>
      Start by deploying an Operator headless application to a Linux server in your environment. This will supply you with
      a fully API-based copy of Operator. You can provision a headless app quickly by using the Connect plugin. Once done, 
      check out the embedded Swagger docs for details on the included endpoints.
    </li>
    <li>
      Review the adversaries at your disposal in the Operate section. Then head to chains.prelude.org to see them in more detail.
      New ones come out every Tuesday.
    </li>
    <li>
      From the Operate section, download a Pneuma agent and copy it to your target systems. Start your agents, pointing them at your Operator
      instance. You should see them in your red range.
    </li>
    <li>
      After reviewing the Swagger API docs, use cURL to schedule any of the adversaries to run against your red range. Head to 
      login.prelude.org and check your results. You should see each executed operation popping into your dashboard. Note that you'll
      need to enable the Prelude publisher before deploying adversaries for results to show up here. Alternatively, request the results
      directly over the Operator API.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, hook your agent and/or scheduling of adversaries up to your continuous integration (CI) pipeline
      so adversaries constantly probe your target machines, giving your blue team the ability to exercise their 
      detect and response activities. If you have an Enterprise license, you can do this entirely automated using our
      the endpoint product and scheduling available with your account. 
    </li>
  </ol>

  What is a purple team?: |
    Purple Teams exist to ensure and maximize the effectiveness of the Red and Blue teams. They do this by integrating 
    the defensive tactics and controls from the Blue Team with the threats and vulnerabilities found by the Red Team into 
    a single narrative that maximizes both. Ideally Purple shouldnâ€™t be a team at all, but rather a permanent dynamic between 
    Red and Blue (https://danielmiessler.com/study/red-blue-purple-teams/).
