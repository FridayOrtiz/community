challenge: What Operator training program offers "man pages" for built-in TTPs?
context: |
  Blue teams should use Operator to test their ability to detect common attacks.
  <ol>
    <li>
      Review the adversaries at your disposal in the Operate section. Then head to chains.prelude.org to see them in more detail.
      New ones come out every Tuesday.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click into the Plugins section and install the Publisher plugin. This plugin allows you to forward attack results to your SIEM.
      Once installed, select where you want to send your results.
    </li>
    <li>
      Back in the Operate section, download a Pneuma agent and copy it to your target computers. Start it up and confirm you see the agents
      beaconing into your red range. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Deploy any adversary against your target computers. You'll see the results pop into Operator but they're also forwarding to your 
      configured publisher. Check your chosen SIEM and see if your detections are catching the attack.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider purchasing an Enterprise license, which will give you the SIEM plugin. This plugin connects to your Splunk SIEM and gives
      you the ability to quickly run attacks and monitor detections - even updating saved queries from within Operator itself. Think of 
      the SIEM plugin as a more advanced version of the Publisher plugin.

  What is a blue team?: |
    The group responsible for defending an enterpriseâ€™s use of information systems by maintaining its security posture against a group of 
    mock attackers (i.e., the Red Team). Typically the Blue Team and its supporters must defend against real or simulated attacks 1) 
    over a significant period of time, 2) in a representative operational context (e.g., as part of an operational exercise), and 3) 
    according to rules established and monitored with the help of a neutral group refereeing the simulation or exercise.
