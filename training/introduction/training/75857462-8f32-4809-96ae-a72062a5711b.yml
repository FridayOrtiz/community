challenge: What Operator training program is designed for practicing red team skills?
context: |
  Red teams should use Operator as a manual command-and-control center that allows them to experiment with automation.
  <ol>
    <li>Head to your network settings and change the C2 ip address to 0.0.0.0</li>
    <li>Download a Pneuma agent and start it on a target system, pointed at your C2. Confirm you see the agent in your red range.</li>
    <li>
      If your agent is connected via TCP, select the reverse-shell icon from it's dashboard to take manual control. If it's not connected 
      over TCP, hot-swap the protocol used through the agent configuration icon.
    </li>
    <li>
      Head into the Editor section. This is your "attack IDE" containing all your TTPs and payloads. From here, build a custom adversary.
      Take note you can attach arbitrary payloads (binaries) to your TTPs. Before the TTP is executed on target, the payload will drop on 
      disk - so your command can assume it's there.
    </li>
    <li>Click back to the Operate section, select your red range and deploy your new adversary against it.</li>
    <li>
      Head to the Connect section. Deploy a redirector so you can start accepting agent beacons over the internet. Once your
      redirector is connected, deploy agents pointed at it's hostname instead of your Operator's ip address. 
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have an Enterprise license, you can send a teammate your redirector host/password combo which they can use
      to link their Operator instance to you. Now any agent beacon which comes to you, them or your redirector will mirror 
      to both of you. Add more teammates anytime.
    </li>
  </ol>

  What is a red team?: |
    A group of people authorized and organized to emulate a potential adversary’s attack or exploitation capabilities against an 
    enterprise’s security posture. The Red Team’s objective is to improve enterprise cybersecurity by demonstrating the impacts of 
    successful attacks and by demonstrating what works for the defenders (i.e., the Blue Team) in an operational environment. 
    Also known as Cyber Red Team. (NIST, https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/red_team)
