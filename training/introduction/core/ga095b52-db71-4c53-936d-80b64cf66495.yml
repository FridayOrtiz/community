name: Understanding chains
challenge: We have written a couple of chains to emulate several N-day attacks. Enter the name of one.
context: |
  There are many nuanced terms in cybersecurity, often overlapping with others. It can be tough to keep track
  of them all. Inside Operator, we try to use as few custom terms as possible and try to over-explain terminology
  wherever possible to make it easier to onboard and make sense of an already complex industry. Two terms come
  up often in the app: adversary and chain, so let's look at them a little closer. The term chain was originally used
  in the CALDERA framework to describe a subset of an attacker's overall operation. A chain includes n-number of
  individual TTPs, which work together to achieve some type of output. The term adversary is a common cybersecurity term, 
  often referring to the attacker overall. An adversary can be thought of as any person or group running unauthorized
  code on a computer. Even an insider threat could be an adversary. An adversary in the real-world may know how to
  execute dozens of chained attacks. We emulate this by allowing you to pick a prebuilt chain and then append more TTPs
  to it.

  Script kiddie: |
    In programming and hacking cultures, a script kiddie, skiddie or skid, is an unskilled individual who uses scripts
    or programs, such as a web shell, developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites.
    It is generally assumed that most script kiddies are juveniles who lack the ability to write sophisticated programs
    or exploits on their own and that their objective is to try to impress their friends or gain credit in
    computer-enthusiast communities. However, the term does not relate to the actual age of the participant.
  Nation state actor: |
    The Nation State Actor has a 'License to Hack'. They work for a government to disrupt or compromise target
    governments, organizations or individuals to gain access to valuable data or intelligence, and can create incidents
    that have international significance.
  An example chain: |
    We often highlight the 'File Hunter' chain in Operator demonstrations because it's a cross-platform chain that
    highlights the concept well. In this chain, the included TTPs will locate recently-modified files, create a staging 
    directory, copy the found files into the directory, compress the directory, and finally exfiltrate the compressed
    file back to Operator.
  TTP Tuesday: |
    Every week, the Prelude security team publishes a new chain. The chain will have a handful of TTPs and will
    automatically load into Operator, available to Professional license holders. You can read about each chain on our
    site: https://chains.prelude.org.
