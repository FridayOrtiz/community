name: Create a new TTP
challenge: |
  Create a new TTP named 'Hello World' that prints ‘hello world’ to console. Deploy it against your ThirdEye agent.
context: |
  One of the unique aspects of Operator is the ability to quickly create your own TTPs and load them in the system.
  By creating a new YML file and ensuring the format matches that of other files in the Community repository, you are
  able to add them to Operator. The easiest way to create TTPs is through the Launch Chain sidebar, which will create
  a structured YML file and allow you to just fill in the blanks. In your new TTP, you can create any type of attack 
  you want - just be sure that it is valid YML and it contains at least 1 platform and 1 executor, so it can run.

  Choosing a platform & executor: |
    Each TTP requires a platform (operating system) and an executor (program the agent uses to run the TTP). There are 
    3 supported platforms in Operator today: Windows, Linux and Darwin (the Apple/Mac OS). By default, each platform
    can use a specific set of executors. Check the documentation around TTPs for the list of options.
  Modern securities: |
    In cybersecurity, the efforts to combat infiltrations are constantly evolving. Security systems will try to recognize
    attack patterns through various means like monitoring network activity to identify illicit traffic or by monitoring
    employee command line behavior to spot and stop malicious code phrases). One strategy agents use to avoid detection
    is to run an executor that is less familiar to the blue team (but still compatible with the agent's operating system).
answer:
  script: |
    Agent.a.filter(function(a) {
        let links = a.links.filter(function(l) {
            return l.response.output.toLowerCase() === 'hello world'
        })
        return links.length > 0
    }).length
