name: ThirdEye
challenge: What executors does your ThirdEye agent have?
context: |
  When performing a command-and-control (C2) attack, you need two parts, a command center (in this case, Operator) and
  agents running on compromised systems. An agent, otherwise known as a Remote Access Trojan, is a piece of malicious
  software running on a target computer. From the compromised device, the agent beacons into the command center
  indicating that it is ready to receive instructions (TTPs), and then executes any instructions the command center 
  sends back. Operator includes a safe, built-in agent known as <b>ThirdEye<b>. It only communicates with Operator locally and
  is intended for testing attacks before releasing them into the wild.

  Remote Access Trojan: |
    A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance, a backdoor for administrative
    control and unfettered and unauthorized remote access to a victimâ€™s machine. The RAT is very dangerous
    because it enables intruders to get remote control of the compromised computer. Attackers can use the exploited
    machines to perform various malicious activities such as installing and removing programs, manipulating files,
    hijacking the webcam, reading data from the keyboard, harvesting login credentials and monitoring the clipboard.
  Remote Code Execution: |
    Remote code execution (RCE) refers to the ability of a cyberattacker to access and make changes to a computer owned
    by another, without authority and regardless of where the computer is geographically located. RCE can happen through
    nearly any application running on a computer, through a variety of mechanisms, such as injecting code into the
    running application or taking advantage of a security vulnerability within the app. RATs also naturally provide an
    attacker-owned application which opens up RCE on a computer as well, which gives them "ownership" of the machine.
  Executors: |
    In this case, executors refer to the programming language used to run a TTP. Some available executors are: sh, psh,
    pwsh, python, and keyword. It's up to the agent to define which executors it supports, and you can define your
    preferred order to use them within Operator. The executor must be compatible with the agent's operating system and
    the TTP must list the executor in order for the attack to be successful. For a full list of available executors
    that work with the default Prelude agent head to the documentation section.
