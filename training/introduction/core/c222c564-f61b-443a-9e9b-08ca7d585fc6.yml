name: Understanding TTPs
challenge: |
  According to its man page, one common variation for the TTP named 'Find recent files' is to vary the __ by which an
  adversary locates recent files.
context: |
  It's often useful to understand the context around a TTP. Prelude writes "man pages" for our TTPs that convey extra
  information about a TTP: why a hacker might use a specific TTP, when to recognize that it might be part of a larger
  attack, how to prevent or detect attacks using the TTP, etc. This should go hand in hand with thinking about the
  bigger picture around who might want to attack you and how they would most likely go about it.

  Indicators of Compromise: |
    An IOC is often described in the forensics world as evidence on a computer that indicates that the security of the
    network has been breached. Investigators usually gather this data after being informed of a suspicious incident,
    on a scheduled basis, or after the discovery of unusual call-outs from the network. An IoC could be an email address,
    IP address, username, website or one of many other objective pieces of data to anchor a finding. For years,
    Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analysts used IOCs to determine who was attacking them. For example, if they knew
    the IP address 1.2.3.4 was owned by the FIN6 hacking group and they saw an attack originating from that address,
    they could draw the conclusion that FIN6 was behind the attack.
  Cyber Kill Chain: |
    IOCs are not foolproof however, as IOCs can be spoofed. Behavior-driven attribution, or the analysis of what an
    attacker intrinsically does, emerged as a popular alternative when the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain appeared
    in public. The Cyber Kill Chain is a series of steps which an attacker goes through start to finish during a 
    cyberattack, from reconnaissance in the beginning to exfiltration of data at the end. The kill chain is intended 
    to organize how an attacker conducts their work instead of what tools they use to complete it. Lockheed Martin
    originally developed the kill chain from a military model in 2011.
  ATT&CK: |
    Today, the MITRE ATT&CK framework is known as the standard behavior-driven classification system for its simplicity 
    and comprehensiveness. ATT&CK is a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by threat hunters,
    red teamers, and defenders to better classify attacks and assess an organization's risk. Organizations can use the
    framework to identify holes in defenses, and prioritize them based on risk. Prelude organizes all tactics, 
    techniques and procedures (TTPs) according to the ATT&CK framework.
