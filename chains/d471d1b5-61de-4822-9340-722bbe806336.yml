name: LPE in eBPF (CVE-2022-23222)
description: >-
  This exploit causes the eBPF verifier to lose track of register values, which
  can be leveraged to read and write from arbitrary kernelspace memory
  addresses. These arbitrary reads and writes can be used to escalate
  privileges. The vulnerability was first introduced in Linux kernel 5.8, and
  fixed in 5.16. Patches for affected versions have been released.
